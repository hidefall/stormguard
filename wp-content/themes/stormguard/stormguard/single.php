                <p class="article_content">The insurance industry estimates that roofing, siding, windows, and gutter claims, due to hail and wind damage, exceeds billions of dollars each year. Storms and exterior property damage happen all across the country, and throughout the year. And yet, the insurance restoration industry is very fragmented, with no major players. The businesses tend to be small and localized, and business practices vary widely because individual owners use individual methods.</p>
